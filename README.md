# stalewall-demo

The source for the stalewall demo

The page was built with [simplecss](https://simplecss.org) for style and standard HTML, JS and CSS, be warned though
that this page was build quickly and the code is (very) unpolished.

You can find this demo [here](https://spacefall.github.io/stalewall-demo/)
